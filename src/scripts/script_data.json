(CONT'D)\n               The poor dear thought us dead all\n               these years so had kept them on her\n               mantle in memoriam. Zsofia could\n               have only been thirteen years of\n               age at the time but her face and\n               expression are unmistakable. I have\n               included all but one in case this\n               letter does not reach you. I will\n               keep it near my breast, our family\n               tree against my heart.
